# Bob's Computer Repair Shop

This repository hosts the capstone project for the Web-450 Mastering the MEAN Stack Bootcamp. Bob's Computer Repair Shop is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management of computer repair services. Developed using the full MEAN stack, this application offers a robust and scalable platform for handling customer requests, managing repair tickets, and tracking service repairs.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A document-based NoSQL database used for storing all application data.
- **Express.js**: The backend framework running alongside Node.js to handle server-side logic.
- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework used for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side, ensuring a fast and scalable application.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for styling and creating a responsive design, ensuring that our application is accessible and user-friendly across all devices.
- **RESTful APIs**: To ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enabling a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js, Angular CLI, and MongoDB installed on your machine for full functionality.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. Ensure MongoDB is running on your local environment.

### Running the Application

- **Starting the Backend Server**: Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `node server/app.js` to start the Express server on the default port.
- **Starting the Full Application**: In the root directory, you can also use `npm start` which is configured to start both the backend server and the Angular development server, making the full application accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development

### Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.
